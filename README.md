# TrashTossGame
Code repository for CMPS 115-01 Fall 2017.

Trash Toss: A gaming app project implemented by Computer Science 115/116/117 students in collaboration with the IDEASS program.

INSTALLATION GUIDE: Must use Unity 5.5.2p4, conveyor belt flickers otherwise. Different animation system might fix.
https://unity3d.com/unity/qa/patch-releases/5.5.2p4

Must use Android SDK Tools 25.2.5 http://dl.google.com/android/repository/tools_r25.2.5-windows.zip

File -> Build Settings -> Android

Using Unity with Git does not work well at all. Instead, use Unity Collab - version control that is included directly in Unity. Multiple people can collaborate on code and push to the master branch. Only downside is that you cannot go back to a previous state of the project after commiting. So make sure there are no bugs in the code before you add your changes to Unity Collab.
